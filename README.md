# Formula Schedule 2017

##Android App in development
###Features (Ideas)
* Shows F1 schedule
* Click on event to get more info
* time for start of events in local time of phone (and local time of track?)
  
###Notes to self
* basic functionality is in
* need to add page to give credit for images
* need to make it look good
	* is the track map useful?
	* country's flag -> good location / size?
	* pictures from the track?
	* show weather -> could add a link to a weather prediction thing

###Extra Ideas
* Notifications for starts of events
* get events from web / not hardcoded
